Vesting is the process of gradually releasing tokens from a locked account over a specified period of time. This is a common practice in blockchain projects to ensure a smooth transition from the initial token distribution phase to the mainnet launch.

Tokens typically vest over a period of 12 months, with an equal portion of the tokens being released each month.

For example, if you received 12,000 VOI tokens during Testnet Phase 2, then after any optional lock-up period ends you would receive 1,000 VOI tokens each month for the next 12 months. On Voi, locking and vesting is done using Smart Contracts, and as such at the specified interval (usually once per month) your vested tokens will be available for withdrawal from the contract.

All tokens in the locked contract can be staked, and any block rewards earned from staking will be added to the contract's balance. This allows your vested tokens to automatically compound, and earned rewards above your locked and/or un-vested balance are available for withdrawal at any time.
