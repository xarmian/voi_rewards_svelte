VOI tokens can be obtained via one of the following methods:

#### Option 1: Purchase VOI tokens on BuyVoiDotCom.com
[BuyVoiDotCom.com](https://buyvoidotcom.com) is an all-in-one Buy and Bridge solution. Purchase Voi on your favorite supported network using a variety of token options, and receive $VOI tokens directly in your Voi Network account.

#### Option 2: Purchase VOI from a decentralized exchange and bridge to Voi Network using the [Aramid Bridge](https://biatec.notion.site/Aramid-Bridge-User-Guide-10cb2ccb197f809cb3c3de8c93cd67f8). VOI is currently available on the following networks:
 - Algorand ([Pact](https://app.pact.fi/swap?pair=USDC:31566704/ARAMID+VOI:2320775407), [Tinyman](https://app.tinyman.org/swap?asset_in=31566704&asset_out=2320775407))

#### Option 3: Bridge USDC to Voi Network from Algorand, Base, or Arbitrum using the [Aramid Bridge](https://biatec.notion.site/Aramid-Bridge-User-Guide-10cb2ccb197f809cb3c3de8c93cd67f8).
