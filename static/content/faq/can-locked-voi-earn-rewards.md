question: Can **Locked** or Non-vested Voi tokens earn block rewards?
category: Staking

Yes, tokens locked in a Voi Locking and Vesting Contract can earn block rewards by staking the contract's account on a node. This allows the contract's Voi tokens to contribute to the network's security, and for each block proposed by the contract's account the contract will receive a portion of the block rewards.

All tokens in the locked contract can be staked, and any block rewards earned from staking will be added to the contract's balance. This allows your vested tokens to automatically compound, and earned rewards above your locked and/or un-vested balance are available for withdrawal at any time.
