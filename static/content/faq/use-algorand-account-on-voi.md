The mnemonic for your Algorand account can be used on the Voi Network to generate the same Voi Account Address. It is important to note that the re-key state of your Algorand account will not be preserved on the Voi Network, and you will not be able to access your Algorand account from your Voi Account. Your Voi Account will be a separate entity from your Algorand account, sharing only the same Voi Account Address.

In other words, while one mnemonic will result in a Voi Account Address that is the same as your Algorand Account Address, the Voi Account is not the same as the Algorand Account. The Voi Account is a separate entity with its own set of assets, transactions, and other data.

**NOTE:** It is generally recommended that you use a new, separate account on Voi Network for all Voi Network activities to avoid confusion and for improved security.
