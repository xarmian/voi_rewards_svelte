The mnemonic for your Algorand account can be used on the Voi Network to generate the same Voi Account Address. It is important to note that the re-key state of your Algorand account will not be preserved on the Voi Network, and you will not be able to access your Algorand account from your Voi Account. Your Voi Account will be a separate entity from your Algorand account, sharing only the same Voi Account Address.
