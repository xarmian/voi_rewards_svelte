To create your first Voi Account, you will first need to choose a Voi Wallet. There are multiple wallet options available, including:

- [Kibisis](https://kibis.is/) (browser extension)
- [Lute](https://lute.io/) (webapp and extension, with Ledger support)
- [Biatec Wallet](https://wallet.biatec.io/) (webapp)

For more information, visit the [official Voi documentation on wallets](https://docs.voi.network/ecosystem/wallets/). Each wallet will allow you to create one or more Voi Accounts, and each account will have a unique 25-word mnemonic, or secret key. Store this secret key in a secure location, and do not share it with anyone. You will need this secret key to access your Voi Account.
