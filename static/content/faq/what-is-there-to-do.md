There are many things you can do with your Voi, and more being added every day! The Voi token's primary purpose is to be the currency used to pay for transactions on the Voi blockchain.

You can also stake your Voi and operate a node to earn Voi as a reward each week, participate in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), purchase and trade NFTs, and more.

For more information about staking in the Voi Staking Program, please refer to the [Voi Staking Guide](https://medium.com/@voifoundation/staking-program-how-to-guide-382ea5085dab).
