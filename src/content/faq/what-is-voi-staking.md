Staking in Voi refers to the process of delegating your VOI tokens to support the network's operations. By staking, the tokens in your account will contribute toward voting for the inclusion of new blocks. The proposer of each block will be rewarded for each block that is proposed.

For additional information about running a Node and staking, please refer to the [How to Node](/how_to_node) section of this website.
