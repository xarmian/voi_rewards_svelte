Yes, your account is interchangeable between Voi wallets. In fact, since your Voi Account is entirely contained on the blockchain, meaning when you move between wallets you're just using a different program to "view" your account information and sign transactions, you can use your mnemonic to move your account between wallets or even use the same account with multiple wallets.
