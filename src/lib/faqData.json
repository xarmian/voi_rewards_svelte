    "question": "Can **Locked** or Non-vested Voi tokens earn rewards?",
    "answer": "Yes, tokens locked in a Voi Locking and Vesting Contract can earn block rewards by staking the contract's account on a node. This allows the contract's Voi tokens to contribute to the network's security, and for each block proposed by the contract's account the contract will receive a portion of the block rewards.\n\nAll tokens in the locked contract can be staked, and any block rewards earned from staking will be added to the contract's balance. This allows your vested tokens to automatically compound, and earned rewards above your locked and/or un-vested balance are available for withdrawal at any time.",

    "question": "How do I create a Voi Account?",
    "answer": "To create your first Voi Account, you will first need to choose a Voi Wallet. There are multiple wallet options available, including:\n\n- [Kibisis](https://kibis.is/) (browser extension)\n- [Lute](https://lute.io/) (webapp and extension, with Ledger support)\n- [Biatec Wallet](https://wallet.biatec.io/) (webapp)\n\nFor more information, visit the [official Voi documentation on wallets](https://docs.voi.network/ecosystem/wallets/). Each wallet will allow you to create one or more Voi Accounts, and each account will have a unique 25-word mnemonic, or secret key. Store this secret key in a secure location, and do not share it with anyone. You will need this secret key to access your Voi Account.",

    "question": "How can I obtain **VOI** tokens?",
    "answer": "VOI tokens can be obtained via one of the following methods:\n\n#### Option 1: Purchase VOI tokens on a centralized exchange. VOI is currently available on\n- [Mexc](https://www.mexc.com/exchange/VOI_USDT)\n- [Coinstore](https://www.coinstore.com/spot/VOIUSDT) \n\n#### Option 2: Purchase VOI from a decentralized exchange and bridge to Voi Network using the [Aramid Bridge](https://biatec.notion.site/Aramid-Bridge-User-Guide-10cb2ccb197f809cb3c3de8c93cd67f8). VOI is currently available on the following networks:\n - Algorand ([Pact](https://app.pact.fi/swap?pair=USDC:31566704/ARAMID+VOI:2320775407), [Tinyman](https://app.tinyman.org/swap?asset_in=31566704&asset_out=2320775407))\n - Base\n - Arbitrum \n\n#### Option 3: Bridge USDC to Voi Network from Algorand, Base, or Arbitrum using the [Aramid Bridge](https://biatec.notion.site/Aramid-Bridge-User-Guide-10cb2ccb197f809cb3c3de8c93cd67f8).

    "question": "If I have a Kibisis Wallet, can I move my account to Lute or Biatec Wallet, etc.?",
    "answer": "Yes, your account is interchangeable between Voi wallets. In fact, since your Voi Account is entirely contained on the blockchain, meaning when you move between wallets you're just using a different program to \"view\" your account information and sign transactions, you can use your mnemonic to move your account between wallets or even use the same account with multiple wallets.",

    "answer": "The mnemonic for your Algorand account can be used on the Voi Network to generate the same Voi Account Address. It is important to note that the re-key state of your Algorand account will not be preserved on the Voi Network, and you will not be able to access your Algorand account from your Voi Account. Your Voi Account will be a separate entity from your Algorand account, sharing only the same Voi Account Address.",

    "question": "What is the **Voi Staking Program**?",
    "answer": "The Voi Staking Program is a key initiative designed to incentivize early participation and long-term commitment to the Voi network. It offers two main ways to earn rewards:\n\n1. Locking up tokens: By locking VOI tokens in a special contract, you can earn bonus rewards through an airdrop. The bonus depends on when you stake (earlier weeks offer higher rewards) and how long you lock up (longer periods provide higher bonus rates).\n\n2. Staking for network security: By staking your locked and bonus tokens on a node, you contribute to network security and earn block rewards.\n\nKey features include:\n- Exclusive access through partner exchanges\n- Incentivized early lockup with decreasing weekly bonuses\n- Flexible lockup durations (1-18 months)\n- Weekly cap of 50 million tokens with an overflow mechanism\n- Immediate bonus and block rewards\n\nThe program started on September 30th, following the exchange listings on September 26th. For detailed information and participation instructions, refer to the [Voi Staking Guide](https://medium.com/@voifoundation/staking-program-how-to-guide-382ea5085dab).",

  {
    "question": "What does **Vesting** mean?",
    "answer": "Vesting is the process of gradually releasing tokens from a locked account over a specified period of time. This is a common practice in blockchain projects to ensure a smooth transition from the initial token distribution phase to the mainnet launch.\n\nTokens typically vest over a period of 12 months, with an equal portion of the tokens being released each month.\n\nFor example, if you received 12,000 VOI tokens during Testnet Phase 2, then after any optional lock-up period ends you would receive 1,000 VOI tokens each month for the next 12 months. On Voi, locking and vesting is done using Smart Contracts, and as such at the specified interval (usually once per month) your vested tokens will be available for withdrawal from the contract.\n\nAll tokens in the locked contract can be staked, and any block rewards earned from staking will be added to the contract's balance. This allows your vested tokens to automatically compound, and earned rewards above your locked and/or un-vested balance are available for withdrawal at any time.",
